# 🚴 Adventure Works Cycles Analysis

Adventure Works is a **Microsoft sample database** that simulates a multinational manufacturing company producing and selling cycles and related products.  
In this project, I connected and shaped the raw data using **Power Query**, built a **relational data model**, and created **calculated fields with DAX measures**.  
Finally, I developed an **interactive Power BI Dashboard** to analyze the company’s sales performance, customer demographics, and product profitability.

## 💡 Project Overview
This project aims to provide **actionable insights** for Adventure Works management by answering key business questions such as:
- Which customers and regions contribute the most to profit?  
- What product categories drive sales growth?  
- How do demographics (income, occupation) affect customer behavior?  
- How does pricing impact profitability (via What-If analysis)?  

The final dashboard is designed to help stakeholders make **data-driven decisions** and track performance effectively.
